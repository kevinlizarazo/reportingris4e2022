description: As I traipsed through the sands of Potrillo Volcanic Fields, sweat
  dripping off my brow, I couldn’t get over the fact that for geologists, this
  lifestyle is their 9-5. While craters might seem nothing more than a useless
  wasteland to some, they are a geologist’s paradise. Across three days, I
  gained insight on the immense preparation going into future space exploration,
  all while soaking up some of the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen.

As I traipsed through the sands of Potrillo Volcanic Fields, sweat dripping off my brow, I couldn’t get over the fact that for geologists, this lifestyle is their 9-5.

Across three days, I gained insight on the immense preparation going into future space exploration, all while soaking up some of the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen.
