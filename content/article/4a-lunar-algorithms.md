For six years, Ben Feist sat at his computer on evenings and weekends working on a project fueled solely by passion. It won him two Emmy awards — and it got him a job at NASA. The project was to recreate NASA’s Apollo space mission for the public to experience. 
 
That project was Apollo in Real Time, in which Feist researched, reconstructed archival material and coded a website that essentially rebuilt NASA’s historical records of Apollo 17 and later Apollo 11 and 13. The interactive, multimedia site features the photographs, videos and audio of the original historical mission with synchronization and digital transcripts.

The public can relive the missions as they occurred in 1969, 1970 and 1972 by joining at 1 minute to launch, or by joining in-progress at exactly the same time they are visiting the site — except rewind to over 50 years ago. The standard engagement time, or the amount of time visitors are staying and interacting on a web page, is between 2-3 minutes. The engagement time of ApolloInRealTime.org was over 10 minutes — an “eternity for Internet standards,” Feist said. 

The Apollo 17 journey in real time features all mission control film footage, all on-board television and film footage, 302 hours of space-to-ground audio, all on-board recorder audio, over 3,600 photographs and 35,800 searchable utterances, as listed on ApolloInRealTime.org.  

Due to Feist’s Apollo17.org project, Dr. Noah Petro of Goddard Space Flight Center invited Feist to speak at the 44th anniversary of the Apollo 17 mission in December 2016. After the talk, Jacob Bleacher and Patrick Whelley of NASA said that Feist may have solved a problem to which NASA was searching for an answer. And it had to do with contextual data.

Contextual data offers a broader look into the data collected by providing background information. In NASA’s case, the amount of data astronauts will collect on future missions will only continue to grow, especially from the era of the Apollo missions. Feist’s organization of data in Apollo17.org could solve that problem, because it could be applied to organizing and analyzing field data. 

Feist created prototypes displaying how he could help the scientific community at NASA through organizing contextual data. And this brought Feist to where he is now: a software engineer in data visualization and informatics in the Astromaterials Research & Exploration Science (ARES) division at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas as a Jacobs contractor.

His contributions at NASA impact humanity’s journey of returning to the moon. Feist is the creator of the team-effort, system-made software called CODA, which revolves around the importance of contextual data. “CODA is like a security camera,” said Feist. It is a “contextual playback of the data.”

In April 2022, RISE2 scientists went to the Potrillo volcano field in New Mexico to conduct an analog mission. Feist was the designated data sub-team lead for all field science exercises during the trip. These activities, referred to as extravehicular activities, or EVAs, are test experiments that are run through by mock astronauts to ensure they are able to follow the necessary duties and commands that an astronaut would have to complete to collect data on a mission. 

“It is excellent to have Ben Feist on the field team,” said Patrick Whelley of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “His background is different from most of the rest of the team, so his questions are different, from a different perspective. This makes us geologists double check our assumptions and be more effective scientists. Also, Ben is a fun person to be around. If Ben is on the team, sign me up.”

Feist was responsible for recording everything the mock astronauts completed on the scripted EVA tests, including mock-up science data to then put it into a data system. “My job was to look for ways to gather the scientific data produced by the equipment in the field in a way that could be utilized to represent in a contextual replay system, like CODA,” Feist said. 

CODA is time-based, so its emphasis is on when something occurred. It captures video, audio, field notes and telemetry. It also monitors the battery level and motion sensors on the suit at any given time. CODA does test events and neutral buoyancy laboratories, in addition to the International Space Station. 

“Ben’s work is transforming RISE2 science,” said Cherie Achilles of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “By integrating individual datasets into a spectacular visual narrative, Ben is generating an integrative science product that is helping our science team understand the geologic history of Kilbourne Hole. He and the RISE2 science team are paving the way for how astronauts on the Moon can utilize in situ data to explore and investigate the lunar surface.”

Feist is the recipient of at least 20 honors and awards, and has won the Johnson Space Center Exceptional Software Award and the Johnson Space Center Director’s Innovation Award just this past year.

Feist was always interested in space. The Apollo 13 movie with Tom Hanks “changed everything” for Feist, he said. It’s what spurred his fascination with outer space — and with teamwork. 

The movie depicts the true story of figuring out a way to get astronauts back to safety after their spacecraft experiences massive internal damage. Feist perceives the Apollo 13 to be the most important shuttle because of the teamwork and communication in the control room.

Feist holds a bachelor’s of arts in English and computer science. His path to NASA was unusual: He did not attend graduate school, and he did not climb the ladder, as he says many do. Instead, he worked in the private sector for 22 years. “What I don’t have in the academic sector, I have in the private sector,” Feist said.

The secret to Ben’s success is the fact that he says “yes.” And by following his passion.
